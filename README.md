### Hey! Some quick bits about me:

I'm passionate about all things Urban! Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my knowledge of Google Earth Engine and remote sensing!

- 🔭 I'm studying a Python data science handbook with a specific focus on IPython, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- 📚 Currently also learning the Geospatial Python Libraries (rasterio, geopandas, xarray, shapely, fiona, leafmap)
- 🌱 I'm actively researching geospatial areas previously degrading, incorporating regenerative agroforestry.
- 👨‍💼 I'm looking to get further exposure on urban geospatial analysis projects.
